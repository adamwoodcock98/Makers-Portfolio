Week 8/9 - Group Engineering Project: Acebook (Koala)
=========

This will be our second group engineering project at Makers where we aim to create a clone of Facebook using the MEHN stack, from a pre-existing seed project.

Goals
-------

By the end of this project, our goal is to answer yes to the following question:

**Can you use high-quality processes to build a project in a team?**

In addition, our projects will be worked against the [project criteria](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/final_projects/project_criteria.md).

Evidence
--------

The main goal of this project is high-quality teamwork, there is a lot of evidence from our teams work that supports this goal:
