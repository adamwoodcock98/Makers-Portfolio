### Learning objectives

1. Define process modelling as a tool to describe and understand a process
2. Use process modelling to further your understanding of HTTP requests and responses.

---

### What is process modelling?

* Creating a model of some process
* Breaking the process down into steps
* Understand how asctors of the process interact with one another
* Diagram (or another type of modelling)

### What do you know about HTTP?

* A protocol to exchange between client and server
* Used through a browser (or another a tool like Terminal)
* Headers (metadata) and body are exchanged
* We can use HTTP to send HTML, CSS, images, raw data, audio etc.
* Request & response using things such as GET and POST
  * GET requests receive data through responses in the URL
  * POST requests receive data through responses in the body

### Practical

The goal is to follow the instructions found [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/how_the_web_works/process_modelling) and diagram all of the steps:
