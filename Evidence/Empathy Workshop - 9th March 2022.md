### Why might empathy be missing?

* Anger
  * Feeling numb towards another’s pain
  * Contempt instead of warmth, lecturing, cold reception
* Protection
  * Unconsciously feeling as though another’s pain is like a ‘virus’
  * If you allow yourself to support them you can ‘catch’ it and be closer to pain
* Identifying
  * Another’s painful feelings might be ‘too close to home’, bringing up your own issue with the subject
  * Try to rationalise/talk them out of their feelings in an attempt to avoid your own
* Fear of intimacy
  * Being emotionally distant distant seems easier that the risk of vulnerability and closeness

### How do we train empathy?

1. ‘Just like me’
  1. We feel naturally more empathetic when we think that a person is more like ourself
  2. The tool is to look for something that might be similar.
    1. Could be an interest, an emotion, a goal, a posession.
    2. Literally anything you may share with that person
    3. People will respond much more to someones energy than they do their words

    1. Reflect back, paraphrase what they said
    2. Ask questions, instead of giving answers
    3. Validate emotions, even if you disagree with their logic
    4. Don’t offer unsolicited advice
    5. Be present - 80/20 listening
