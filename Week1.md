# Week 1 - Debugging & TDD
This week is all about test-driving our programs, an exploration of the steps involved so that we can continue on with the approach throughout the rest of our course and careers. We will be introduced to driver-navigator pair programming and explore the debugging process.

## Goals
1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Tying our weekly goals into our course goals
This week will touch upon some of our overall goals that we want to achieve from the course as a whole.<br /><br />
**_I can TDD anything_** *- Write meaningful tests, based on user requirements, writing the code using TDD to pass tests*<br />
**_I can program fluently_** *- Setup and create Ruby project structure, turning domain models into working code*/<br />
**_I can debug anything_** *- Learning a consistent approach to uncovering the root-cause of bugs in our code*

## Plans to achieve my goals
1. Complete the Boris Bikes challenge and attend the workshops on TDD.
2. Use GitHub collaboration to complete our weekly challenge.
3. Complete some debugging exercises, record the progress.
4. Work through relevant exercies. Explore Ruby documentation and do some research on SRP.

## Evidence
1. Commits on [my Boris Bikes repo](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/boris-bikes) with pair partner Chris, and on the [Boris Bikes 2 repo]() with pair partner Joe show the extensive step-by-step process used with my partner for development using TDD.
2. The GitHub collaboration for the completion of the [Boris Bikes challenge](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/boris-bikes) evidences the use of the driver-navigator technique through the repos commits.

## Daily Reflections
I have spent time creating a blog to follow my thoughts/feelings and a record of the day-to-day on the Makers course. Any of these can be accessed by following the links for the relevant days.
