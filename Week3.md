# Week 3 - Simple Web Apps
This week we are moving onto web development. We will explore HTTP and the client-server/request-response cycle, HTML/CSS, the MVC pattern and RESTful APIs. We will also look at testing multiple frameworks (Ruby & Sinatra) using Rspec and Capybara.

## Goals
Build a simple web app (this primary goal breaks down into the sub-goals below):
  1. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
  2. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
  3. Explain the MVC pattern

## Plans to achieve my goals
  1. By attending the workshop and completing a practical.
  2. By completing the Sinatra Cat challenge and attending relevant workshops.
  3. By doing research to support my understanding.

## Evidence
1. We completed the [Battle's challenge](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/battle), this is our first demonstration of a complete simple web application.
2. Our ultra-simple [Sinatra cat challenge](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/sinatra-cat) walked us through the basics of web development, following the first 16 steps of [this challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/intro_to_the_web). The [counter practical](https://github.com/makersacademy/count-sinatra) also gave us some essential basic skills, before starting the main challenges. Finally, we had a [workshop on the HTTP modelling process](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/Process%20Modelling%20Workshop%20-%208th%20March%202022.md).

## Daily Reflections
I have spent time creating a blog to follow my thoughts/feelings and a record of the day-to-day on the Makers course. Any of these can be accessed by following the links for the relevant days.
