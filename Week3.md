# Week 3 - Simple Web Apps
This week we are moving onto web development. We will explore HTTP and the client-server/request-response cycle, HTML/CSS, the MVC pattern and RESTful APIs. We will also look at testing multiple frameworks (Ruby & Sinatra) using Rspec and Capybara.

## Goals
1. Build a simple web app (this primary goal breaks down into the sub-goals below)
  1. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
  2. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
  3. Explain the MVC pattern

## Plans to achieve my goals
1. Through the completion of the Battles challenge.
  1. By attending the workshop and completing a practical.
  2. By completing the Sinatra Cat challenge and attending relevant workshops.
  3. By doing research to support my understanding.

## Evidence
