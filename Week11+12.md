Week 11/12 - Final Project: Travel Angel
========

This is our final group project taking the last 2 weeks of our course at Makers. In this project, we will create our own project and idea from scratch.

We will be making a website that stores all of your travel documentation for any upcoming international trips. You can use the app to store your flights, accommodation, transfers, parking, visas, COVID tests & vaccinations and passport information. You can upload documents such as booking confirmations, vaccine proof or any other documents you want to keep track of.

Goals
------

The main focus of this project is to complete an extended project in a team, with the intention of getting high-quality experience using industry standard workflows and processes.
