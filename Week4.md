# Week 4 - Database Web Apps
This week we are deepening the concepts and skills we collected in [week 3](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Week3.md), whilst incorporating databases into the apps. We will look at the agile process, continue with TDD and [much more](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/bookmark_manager/learning_objectives.md).

## Goals
1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

## Plans to achieve my goals
1. By completing the weekly challenge and the weekend challenge.
2. Attend the debugging workshop and complete a walkthrough.
3. Complete skills workshops and practicals, conduct additional research as necessary.

## Evidence
1. The [bookmark manager](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/bookmark-manager) project demonstrates a database in a web app, using some custom ORM. We approach this goal extensively using ActiveRecord/Rake in [week 5](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/week5.md).
2. I completed a walkthrough of this process [here](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/debugging-2.md).
3. All of these points are explored in my [research notes](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/How%20do%20databases%20work.md).

## Daily Reflections
I have spent time creating a blog to follow my thoughts/feelings and a record of the day-to-day on the Makers course. Any of these can be accessed by following the links for the relevant days.
