# Week 1 - Debugging & TDD
This week has a large focus on the reinforcement and advancement of the work we did in [week 1](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Week1.md). We will further explore TDD, stretching our knowledge and capabilities of this process, Ruby and object-oriented design.

## Goals
1. Use all of week 1's skills
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### Tying our weekly goals into our course goals
This week will touch upon some of our overall goals that we want to achieve from the course as a whole.<br /><br />
**_I write code that is easy to change_** *- Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.*<br />
**_I can test-drive my code_** *- Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.*/<br />
**_I can build with objects_** *- Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.*

## Daily Reflections
I have spent time creating a blog to follow my thoughts/feelings and a record of the day-to-day on the Makers course. Any of these can be accessed by following the links for the relevant days.
