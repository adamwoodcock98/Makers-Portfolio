# Makers-Portfolio
This is a place for me to track my learning at Makers. A chance to reflect on new concepts, store evidence for the achievement of goals and challenges, and the various processes I've learned and deployed during my time here.

This repo is full of md links, explore them to learn more about each of the weeks of study.
