# Week 5 - Group Engineering Project: MakersBnB

This week we are doing our first group project. The task is to create a clone of the popular hosting website Airbnb.

For the first time, we will be completely unguided, given only a headline spec from a 'client' to work with - the rest is up to us.

## Goals
1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
2. Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives
4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
5. Give and receive meaningful code review

## Evidence

This week functioned a little differently in terms of evidencing all of the above goals. Goals 1, 2, 4 and 5 are evidences in the [repo for our team's Makersbnb (ScareBnB) project](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/makersbnb).

I also completed a *very* detailed [review of this project](), containing evidence for goal 3, whilst critically analysing our performance of the other goals and a lot, lot more. There is evidence, photos, documents, screenshots and even audio files from the project. This was a big project and I wanted to encapsulate as much information as possible from the project.

As per usual, I have included my blog posts below, the posts for this week are slightly longer than normal, but if the review wasn't enought these will breakdown events, thoughts and feelings as they happened throughout the week.

I am extremely proud of the work we acheived in this week and I hope you get some enjoyment out of the sucess of this week.

## Daily Reflections
I have spent time creating a blog to follow my thoughts/feelings and a record of the day-to-day on the Makers course. Any of these can be accessed by following the links for the relevant days.
